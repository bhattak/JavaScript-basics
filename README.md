# JavaScript-basics

## Problem 4
The API doesnt give any result back so there is nothing to show though I implemented  the GET method ,one in html file and other in javascript.

## Problem 5
I assumed the problem as the array(problem was not clear) of objects and sorted those objects in the increasing order of their respective ids.
